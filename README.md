## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an MCA student specializing in **Generative AI**, with strong interest in **machine learning, deep learning, and applied AI systems**.  
I focus on **understanding problems deeply, fixing real-world code issues, and building end-to-end solutions** rather than only theoretical models.

I am actively preparing for **industry roles and internships** in Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI Engineering.
